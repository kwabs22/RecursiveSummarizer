# Recursive Summarizer
The main issue is that context windows mean chunks https://github.com/kwabs22/RecursiveSummarizer/blob/21d7f74f9f76f2fe8ea1b7118f3c91db2aee763c/recursively_summarize.py#L51
--> This leads to the idea of mini summaries which brings the idea of an alternative way to study --> Read a summary then read the summaries used to make that summary then read the summaries ... --> Recursive reading in the opposite direction

This repository + https://openai.com/blog/summarizing-books/ shows the idea of how to summarise recursively but how would recursive reading look like?
